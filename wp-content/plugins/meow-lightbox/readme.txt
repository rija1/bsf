=== GALLERY ===
We believe that choice of the gallery system depends on you. We however recommend you to use the [Meow Gallery](https://wordpress.org/plugins/meow-gallery/).

=== PRO ===
Getting the Pro version will support us and the development of the plugin, and also add those features:

- Deep-Linking: allow sharing an URL that will open the Lightbox directly on a specific image.
- Slideshow: you can start a slideshow from the Lightbox.
- Social Sharing: share the image on social networks.
- Animation: the Lightbox can be animated when opening and closing.
- Google Maps: if GPS is available in your image, a map will be available.

=== IMPORTANT ===
By default, the selector is set for the classes '.entry-content, .gallery, .mgl-gallery'. If you need the Lightbox to be active for more selectors, you will need to update the settings. The plugin will apply the lightbox for images contained by the selector. For more information, please check the [official page](https://meowapps.com/meow-lightbox/).
