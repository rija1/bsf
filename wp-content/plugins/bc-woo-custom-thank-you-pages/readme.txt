=== Why do you need custom thank you pages for WooCommerce? ===
After purchasing product from your shop, your customers will be served the order received/thank you page. While many people think this page is for showing the order details only, pro marketers know that this page is a great chance to present more products to the customers.

Since the customers has already purchased your products, they are more likely to buy others from you.
