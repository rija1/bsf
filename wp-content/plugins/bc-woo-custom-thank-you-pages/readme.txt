=== Why do you need custom thank you pages for WooCommerce? ===
After purchasing product from your shop, your customers will be served the order received/thank you page. While many people think this page is for showing the order details only, pro marketers know that this page is a great chance to present more products to the customers.

Since the customers has already purchased your products, they are more likely to buy others from you.

This plugin allows you to create custom thank you page using any page builders you like. That said you can use:
